# ROS For Beginners: Basics, Motion, and OpenCV - Udemy Course (Kinetic-Melodic ROS Versions)

This repository contains the source code and materials for the Udemy course **ROS For Beginners: Basics, Motion, and OpenCV**. Learn the fundamentals of the Robot Operating System (ROS) and gain practical experience in robot motion and perception using OpenCV.


## Packages

- **topic01_basics**: ROS Basics and Foundation - Learn essential ROS concepts, such as topics, services, messages, and nodes.
- **topic02_motion**: Motion in ROS - Apply the concepts from the basics section to control robot motion and develop various trajectories using a cleaning robot simulation.
- **topic03_perception**: Perception in ROS - Discover how a robot perceives its environment using a camera, and how images are collected in ROS and processed in OpenCV.
- **topic04_perception02_laser**: Arduino Integration - Learn how to use Arduino boards and sensors with ROS using the ROSSERIAL Arduino interface, enabling integration with various Arduino sensors and boards.

### ROS Melodic and OpenCV3

This repository is developed for ROS Melodic, which uses OpenCV3. There are some differences between OpenCV3 and the previous versions (OpenCV4) used in ROS Noetic. The code in this repository has been developed to compile seamlessly on a fresh installation of ROS Melodic.
